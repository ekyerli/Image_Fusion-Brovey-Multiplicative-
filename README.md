1. Multiplicative Method. This is the most simple imagefusion technique. It takes two digital images, for example, high-resolution panchromatic and low-resolution multispectral data and multiplies them pixel by pixel to get a new.
2. Brovey Transform. This is a simple numerical method used to merge different digital data sets. The algorithm based on a Brovey transform uses a formula that normalises multispectral bands used for a red, green, and blue colour display and multiplies the result by high-resolution data to add the intensity or brightness component of the image
For the Brovey transform, the bands of Quickbird data were considered as the multispectral bands, while the HH-polarization of TerraSAR image was considered as the multiplying panchromatic band.
